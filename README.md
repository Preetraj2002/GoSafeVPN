I am trying to build a VPN in Go lang to learn about VPN in general.

Here are steps to build one:
1. Set up a secure communication channel:
    - Use openssl to create cert.pem and key.pem
    - Set TLS connection via certificate
2. Create Client-Server Model:
    - Code server.go
    - Code client.go
3. Implement a symmetric key encryption (AES) for data transfer.
4. Use RSA for Key Exchange
5. Others... still figuring out.
